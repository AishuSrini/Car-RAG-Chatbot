 whether or not the driver and passenger safety belts were buckledfastened;  how far (if at all) the driver was depressing the accelera- tor andor brake pedal; and,  how fast the vehicle was traveling. these data can help provide a better understanding of the cir- cumstances in which crashes and injuries occur. note: edr data are recorded by your vehicle only if a non-triv- ial crash situation occurs; no data are recorded by the edr under normal driving conditions and no personal data (e.g., name, gender, age, and crash location) are recorded. how- ever, other parties, such as law enforcement, could combine the edr data with the type of per- sonally identifying data rou- tinely acquired during a crash investigation. to read data recorded by an edr, special equipment is required, and access to the vehicle or the edr is needed. in addition to the vehicle manufac- turer, other parties, such as law enforcement, that have the spe- cial equipment, can read the information if they have access to the vehicle or the edr. disclosure of the edr data toyota will not disclose the data recorded in an edr to a third party except when:  an agreement from the vehicles owner (or the lessee for a leased vehicle) is obtained  in response to an official request by the police, a court of law or a government agency  for use by toyota in a lawsuit however, if necessary, toyota may:  use the data for research on vehicle safety performance event data recorder 10  disclose the data to a third party for research purposes without disclosing information about the specific vehicle or vehicle owner the srs airbag and seat belt pretensioner devices in your toyota contain explosive chemi- cals. if the vehicle is scrapped with the airbags and seat belt pretensioners left as they are, this may cause an accident such as fire. be sure to have the sys- tems of the srs airbag and seat belt pretensioner removed and disposed of by a qualified ser- vice shop or by your toyota dealer before you scrap your vehicle. special handling may apply, see www.dtsc.ca.gov hazardouswasteperchlorate. your vehicle has components that may contain perchlorate. these components may include the airbags, seat belt pretensioners, wireless remote control batteries, and the batter- ies in the tire pressure warning valve and transmitters. scrapping of your toyota perchlorate material warning general precautions while driving driving under the influence: never drive your vehicle when under the influence of alcohol or drugs that have impaired your ability to oper- ate your vehicle. alcohol and cer- tain drugs delay reaction time, impair judgment and reduce coor- dination, which could lead to an accident that could result in death or serious injury. defensive driving: always drive defensively. anticipate mistakes that other drivers or pedestrians might make and be ready to avoid accidents. driver distraction: always give your full attention to driving. any- thing that distracts the driver, such as adjusting controls, talking on a cellular phone or reading can result in a collision with resulting death or serious injury to you, your occupants or others. general precaution regarding childrens safety never leave children unattended in the vehicle, and never allow children to have or use the key. children may be able to start the vehicle or shift the vehicle into neutral. there is also a danger that children may injure them- selves by playing with the win- dows, the moon roof, or other features of the vehicle. in addi- tion, heat build-up or extremely cold temperatures inside the vehi- cle can be fatal to children. 11 reading this manual explains symbols used in this manual. symbols in this manual symbols meanings warning: explains something that, if not obeyed, could cause death or serious injury to peo- ple. notice: explains something that, if not obeyed, could cause dam- age to or a malfunc- tion in the vehicle or its equipment. indicates operating or working proce- dures. follow the steps in numerical order. symbols in illustrations symbols meanings indicates the action (pushing, turning, etc.) used to operate switches and other devices. indicates the out- come of an operation (e.g. a lid opens). symbols meanings indicates the compo- nent or position being explained. means do not, do not do this, or do not let this happen. 12 searching by name alphabetical index: p.605 searching by installation position pictorial index: p.13 searching by symptom or sound what to do if...

in place onto the carpet. 1 insert the retaining hooks (clips) into the floor mat eye- lets. 2 turn the upper knob of each retaining hook (clip) to secure the floor mats in place. always align the marks . the shape of the retaining hooks (clips) may differ from that shown in the illustration. before driving observe the following before starting off in the vehicle to ensure safety of driving. floor mat warning observe the following precau- tions. failure to do so may cause the drivers floor mat to slip, possibly interfering with the pedals while driving. an unexpectedly high speed may result or it may become difficult to stop the vehi- cle. this could lead to an acci- dent, resulting in death or serious injury. when installing the drivers floor mat do not use floor mats designed for other models or different model year vehicles, even if they are toyota genuine floor mats. only use floor mats designed for the drivers seat. always install the floor mat securely using the retaining hooks (clips) provided. do not use two or more floor mats on top of each other. do not place the floor mat bot- tom-side up or upside-down. 25 1-1. for safe use 1 for safety and security adjust the angle of the seatback so that you are sit- ting straight up and so that you do not have to lean for- ward to steer. (p.133) adjust the seat so that you can depress the pedals fully and so that your arms bend slightly at the elbow when gripping the steering wheel. (p.133) lock the head restraint in place with the center of the head restraint closest to the top of your ears. (p.136) wear the seat belt correctly. (p.27) warning before driving check that the floor mat is securely fixed in the correct place with all the provided retaining hooks (clips). be espe- cially careful to perform this check after cleaning the floor. with the engine stopped and the shift lever in p (continuously variable transmission) or n (manual transmission), fully depress each pedal to the floor to make sure it does not inter- fere with the floor mat. for safe driving for safe driving, adjust the seat and mirror to an appro- priate position before driv- ing. correct driving posture 26 1-1. for safe use make sure that all occupants are wearing their seat belts before driving the vehicle. (p.27) use a child restraint system appropriate for the child until the child becomes large enough to properly wear the vehicles seat belt. (p.48) make sure that you can see backward clearly by adjusting the inside and outside rear view mirrors properly. (p.139, 140) warning for safe driving observe the following precau- tions. failure to do so may result in death or serious injury. do not adjust the position of the drivers seat while driving. doing so could cause the driver to lose control of the vehicle. do not place a cushion between the driver or passenger and the seatback. a cushion may prevent correct posture from being achieved, and reduce the effectiveness of the seat belt and head restraint. do not place anything under the front seats. objects placed under the front seats may become jammed in the seat tracks and stop the seat from locking in place. this may lead to an accident and the adjustment mechanism may also be damaged. always observe the legal speed limit when driving on public roads. when driving over long dis- tances, take regular breaks before you start to feel tired. also, if you feel tired or sleepy while driving, do not force your- self to continue driving and take a break immediately. take care when adjusting the seat position to ensure that other passengers are not injured by the moving seat. when adjusting the seat posi- tion, do not put your hands under the seat or near the mov- ing parts to avoid injury. fingers or hands may become jammed in the seat mechanism. correct use of the seat belts adjusting the mirrors 27 1-1. for safe use 1 for safety and security seat belts make sure that all occu- pants are wearing their seat belts before driving the vehicle. warning observe the following precautions to reduce the risk of injury in the event of sudden braking, sudden swerving or an accident. failure to do so may cause death or serious injury. wearing a seat belt ensure that all passengers wear a seat belt. always wear a seat belt prop- erly. each seat belt should be used by one person only. do not use a seat belt for more than one person at once, including chil- dren. toyota recommends that chil- dren be seated in the rear seat and always use a seat belt andor an appropriate child restraint system. to achieve a proper seating position, do not recline the seat more than necessary. the seat belt is most effective when the occupants are sitting up straight and well back in the seats. do not wear the shoulder belt under your arm. always wear your seat belt low and snug across your hips. pregnant women obtain medical advice and wear the seat belt in the proper way. (p.28) women who are pregnant should position the lap belt as low as possible over the hips in the same manner as other occupants, extending the shoulder belt com- pletely over the shoulder and avoiding belt contact with the rounding of the abdominal area. if the seat belt is not worn prop- erly, not only the pregnant woman, but also the fetus could suffer death or serious injury as a result of sudden braking or a colli- sion. people suffering illness obtain medical advice and wear the seat belt in the proper way.

installing a child restraint system because the belt will not securely hold the child restraint system, increas- ing the risk of death or serious injury in the event of an acci- dent. the personalized extender may not be safe on another vehicle, when used by another person, or at a different seating position other than the one originally intended. notice when using a seat belt extender when releasing the seat belt, press on the buckle release but- ton on the extender, not on the seat belt. this helps prevent damage to the vehicle interior and the extender itself. fastening and releasing

the release button . move the height adjuster up and down as needed until you hear a click. the pretensioners help the seat belts to quickly restrain the occupants by retracting the seat belts when the vehicle is sub- jected to certain types of severe frontal or side collision or a vehi- cle rollover. the pretensioners do not activate in the event of a minor frontal impact, a minor side impact or a rear impact. replacing the belt after the pretensioner has been acti- vated if the vehicle is involved in multiple collisions, the pretensioner will acti- vate for the first collision, but will not activate for the second or subse- quent collisions. warning adjustable shoulder anchor always make sure the shoulder belt is positioned across the cen- ter of your shoulder. the belt should be kept away from your neck, but not falling off your shoul- der. failure to do so could reduce the amount of protection in an accident and cause death or seri- ous injuries in the event of a sud- den stop, sudden swerve or accident. seat belt pretensioners (front seats) warning seat belt pretensioners do not place anything, such as a cushion, on the front passen- gers seat. doing so will disperse the passengers weight, which prevents the sen- sor from detecting the passen- gers weight properly. as a result, the seat belt pretensioner for the front passengers seat may not activate in the event of a collision. if the pretensioner has acti- vated, the srs warning light will come on. in that case, the seat belt cannot be used again and must be replaced at your toyota dealer. 31 1-1. for safe

sensor assembly your vehicle is equipped with advanced airbags designed based on the us motor vehicle safety standards (fmvss208). the airbag sensor assembly (ecu) controls airbag deployment based on information obtained from the sensors etc. shown in the system components diagram above. this information includes crash sever- ity and occupant information. as the airbags deploy, a chemical reaction in the inflators quickly fills the airbags with non-toxic gas to help restrain the motion of the occupants. if the srs airbags deploy (inflate) slight abrasions, burns, bruising etc., may be sustained from srs airbags, due to the extremely high speed deployment (inflation) by hot gases. a loud noise and white powder will be emitted. parts of the airbag module (steer- ing wheel hub, airbag cover and inflator) as well as the front seats, parts of the front and rear pillars, and roof side rails, may be hot for several minutes. the airbag itself may also be hot. the windshield may crack. the brakes

18 mph 20 - 30 kmh frontal collision with a fixed wall that does not move or deform). however, this threshold velocity will be considerably higher in the follow- ing situations:  if the vehicle strikes an object, such as a parked vehicle or sign pole, which can move or deform on impact  if the vehicle is involved in an underride collision, such as a colli- sion in which the front of the vehi- cle underrides, or goes under, the bed of a truck 34 1-1. for safe use depending on the type of collision, it is possible that only the seat belt pretensioners will activate. the srs front airbags for the front passenger will not activate if there is no passenger sitting in the front passenger seat. however, the srs front airbags for the front passenger may deploy if luggage is put in the seat, even if the seat is unoccupied. the srs seat cushion airbag on the front passenger seat will not operate if the occupant is not wearing a seat belt. srs airbag deployment condi- tions (srs side and curtain shield airbags) the srs side and curtain shield airbags will deploy in the event of an impact that exceeds the set threshold level (the level of force corresponding to the impact force produced by an approximately 3300 lb. 1500 kg vehicle colliding with the vehicle cabin from a direction perpendicular to the vehicle orientation at an approxi- mate speed of 12 - 18 mph 20 - 30 kmh). both srs curtain shield airbags may deploy in the event of a severe side collision. both srs curtain shield airbags will deploy in the event of vehicle rollover. both srs curtain shield airbags may also deploy in the event of a severe frontal collision. conditions under which the srs airbags may deploy (inflate), other than a collision the srs front airbags and srs side and curtain shield airbags may also deploy if a serious impact occurs to the underside of your vehi- cle. some examples are shown in the illustration. hitting a curb, edge of pavement or hard surface falling into or jumping over a deep hole landing hard or falling the srs curtain shield airbags may also deploy under the situations shown in the illustration. the angle of vehicle tip-up is mar- ginal. the vehicle skids and hits a curb stone. types of collisions that may not deploy the srs airbags (srs front airbags) the srs front airbags do not gener- ally inflate if the vehicle is involved in a side or rear collision, if it rolls over, or if it is involved in a low-speed frontal collision. but, whenever a collision of any type causes sufficient forward decelera- tion of the vehicle, deployment of the srs front airbags may occur. collision from the side collision from the rear vehicle rollover 35 1-1. for safe use 1 for safety and security types of collisions that may not deploy the srs airbags (srs side and curtain shield airbags) the srs side and curtain shield airbags may not activate if the vehi- cle is subjected to a collision from the side at certain angles, or a colli- sion to the side of the vehicle body other than the passenger compart- ment. collision from the side to the vehi- cle body other than the passenger compartment collision from the side at an angle the srs side airbags do not gener- ally inflate if the vehicle is involved in a frontal or rear collision, if it rolls over, or if it is involved in a low-speed side collision. collision from the front collision from the rear vehicle rollover the srs curtain shield airbags do not generally inflate if the vehicle is involved in a rear collision, if it pitches end over end, or if it is involved in a low-speed side or low-speed frontal collision. collision from the rear pitching end over end when to contact your toyota dealer in the following cases, the vehicle will require inspection andor repair. contact your toyota dealer as soon as possible. any of the srs airbags have been inflated. the front of the vehicle is dam- aged or deformed, or was involved in an accident that was not severe enough to cause the srs front airbags to inflate. a portion of a door or its surround- ing area is damaged, deformed or has had a hole made in it, or the vehicle was involved in an acci- dent that was not severe enough to cause the srs side and curtain shield airbags to inflate. 36 1-1. for safe use the pad section of the steering wheel, dashboard near the front passenger airbag or lower portion of the instrument panel is scratched, cracked, or otherwise damaged. the seat cushion surface is scratched, cracked, or otherwise damaged. the surface of the seats with the srs side airbag is scratched, cracked, or otherwise damaged. the portion of the front pillars, rear pillars or roof side rail garnishes (padding) containing the srs cur- tain shield airbags inside is scratched, cracked, or otherwise damaged. warning srs airbag precautions observe the following precautions regarding the srs airbags. failure to do so may cause death or serious injury. the driver and all passengers in the vehicle must wear their seat belts properly. the srs airbags are supple- mental devices to be used with the seat belts. the srs driver airbag deploys with considerable force, and can cause death or serious injury especially if the driver is very close to the airbag. the national highway traffic safety administration (nhtsa) advises: since the risk zone for the drivers airbag is the first 2 - 3 in. (50 - 75 mm) of inflation, placing yourself 10 in. (250 mm) from your driver airbag provides you with a margin of safety. this distance is mea- sured from the center of the steer- ing wheel to your breastbone. if you sit less than 10 in. (250 mm) away now, you can change your driving position in several ways:  move your seat to the rear as far as you can while still reach- ing the pedals comfortably. 37 1-1. for safe use 1 for safety and security warning  slightly recline the back of the seat. although vehicle designs vary, many drivers can achieve the 10 in. (250 mm) distance, even with the driver seat all the way forward, simply by reclining the back of the seat somewhat. if reclining the back of your seat makes it hard to see the road, raise yourself by using a firm, non-slippery cushion, or raise the seat if your vehicle has that feature.  if your steering wheel is adjust- able, tilt it downward. this points the airbag toward your chest instead of your head and neck. the seat should be adjusted as recommended by nhtsa above, while still maintaining control of the foot pedals, steering wheel, and your view of the instrument panel controls. if the seat belt extender has been connected to the front seat belt buckles but the seat belt extender has not also been fastened to the latch plate of the seat belt, the srs front airbags will judge that the driver and front passenger are wearing the seat belt even though the seat belt has not been connected. in this case, the srs front airbags may not activate correctly in a collision, resulting in death or serious injury in the event of a collision. be sure to wear the seat belt with the seat belt extender. the srs front passenger airbag also deploys with consid- erable force, and can cause death or serious injury espe- cially if the front passenger is very close to the airbag. the front passenger seat should be as far from the airbag as possi- ble with the seatback adjusted, so the front passenger sits upright. 38 1-1. for safe use warning improperly seated andor restrained infants and children can be killed or seriously injured by a deploying airbag. an infant or child who is too small to use a seat belt should be properly secured using a child restraint system. toyota strongly recom- mends that all infants and chil- dren be placed in the rear seats of the vehicle and properly restrained. the rear seats are safer for infants and children than the front passenger seat. (p.48) do not sit on the edge of the seat or lean against the dash- board. do not allow a child to stand in front of the srs front passenger airbag unit or sit on the knees of a front passenger. do not allow the front seat occu- pants to hold items on their knees. do not lean against the door, the roof side rail or the front, side and rear pillars. do not allow anyone to kneel on the passenger seats toward the door or put their head or hands outside the vehicle. do not attach anything to or lean anything against areas such as the dashboard, steering wheel pad and lower portion of the instrument panel. these items can become pro- jectiles when the srs driver, front passenger and knee airbags deploy. 39 1-1. for safe use 1 for safety and security warning do not attach anything to areas such as a door, windshield, side windows, front or rear pillar, roof side rail and assist grip. (except for the speed limit label p.525) vehicles without a smart key system: do not attach any heavy, sharp or hard objects such as keys and accessories to the key. the objects may restrict the srs knee airbag inflation or be thrust into the drivers seat area by the force of the deploying airbag, thus caus- ing a danger. do not hang hangers or other hard objects on the coat hooks. all of these items could become projectiles and may cause death or serious injury, should the srs curtain shield airbags deploy. if a vinyl cover is put on the area where the srs drivers knee airbag will deploy, be sure to remove it. do not use seat accessories which cover the parts where the srs side airbags and srs seat cushion airbag inflate as they may interfere with inflation of the srs airbags. such acces- sories may prevent the side airbags and seat cushion airbag from activating correctly, disable the system or cause the side airbags and seat cushion airbag to inflate accidentally, resulting in death or serious injury. do not strike or apply significant levels of force to the area of the srs airbag components or the front doors. doing so can cause the srs airbags to malfunction. do not touch any of the compo- nent parts immediately after the srs airbags have deployed (inflated) as they may be hot. if breathing becomes difficult after the srs airbags have deployed, open a door or win- dow to allow fresh air in, or leave the vehicle if it is safe to do so. wash off any residue as soon as possible to prevent skin irritation. if the areas where the srs airbags are stored, such as the steering wheel pad and front and rear pillar garnishes, are damaged or cracked, have them replaced by your toyota dealer. do not place anything, such as a cushion, on the front passen- gers seat. doing so will disperse the passengers weight, which prevents the sen- sor from detecting the passen- gers weight properly. as a result, the srs front airbags for the front passenger may not deploy in the event of a colli- sion. 40 1-1. for safe use warning modification and disposal of srs airbag system compo- nents do not dispose of your vehicle or perform any of the following modi- fications without consulting your toyota dealer. the srs airbags may malfunction or deploy (inflate) accidentally, causing death or serious injury. installation, removal, disassem- bly and repair of the srs

discon- nect the extender tongue from the seat belt buckle, and recon- nect the seat belt. reconnect the seat belt extender after making sure the air bag on indicator light is illuminated. if you use the seat belt extender while the air bag off indi- cator light is illuminated, the srs airbags for the front pas- senger may not activate, which could cause death or serious injury in the event of a collision. do not apply a heavy load to the front passenger seat or equip- ment (e.g. seatback pocket). do not put weight on the front passenger seat by putting your hands or feet on the front pas- senger seat seatback from the rear passenger seat. do not let a rear passenger lift the front passenger seat with their feet or press on the seatback with their legs. do not put objects under the front passenger seat. do not recline the front passen- ger seatback so far that it touches the rear seat. this may cause the air bag off indi- cator light to be illuminated, which indicates that the srs airbags for the front passenger will not activate in the event of a severe accident. if the seatback touches the rear seat, return the seatback to a position where it does not touch the rear seat. keep the front passenger seatback as upright as possible when the vehicle is moving. reclining the seatback exces- sively may lessen the effective- ness of the seat belt system. if an adult sits in the front pas- senger seat, the air bag on indicator light is illuminated. if the air bag off indicator is illuminated, ask the passenger to sit up straight, well back in the seat, feet on the floor, and with the seat belt worn correctly. if the air bag off indicator still remains illuminated, either ask the passenger to move to the rear seat, or if that is not possible, move the front pas- senger seat fully rearward. when it is unavoidable to install a forward-facing child restraint system on the front passenger seat, install the child restraint system on the front passenger seat in the proper order.

(p.558) warning observe the following precau- tions. failure to do so may result in death or serious injury. when starting the vehicle (vehicles with a continuously variable transmission) always keep your foot on the brake pedal while stopped with the engine running. this prevents the vehicle from creeping. 153 4-1. before driving 4 driving warning when driving the vehicle do not drive if you are unfamil- iar with the location of the brake and accelerator pedals to avoid depressing the wrong pedal.  accidentally depressing the accelerator pedal instead of the brake pedal will result in sudden acceleration that may lead to an accident.  when backing up, you may twist your body around, leading to a difficulty in operating the pedals. make sure to operate the pedals properly.  make sure to keep a correct driving posture even when mov- ing the vehicle only slightly. this allows you to depress the brake and accelerator pedals properly.  depress the brake pedal using your right foot. depressing the brake pedal using your left foot may delay response in an emer- gency, resulting in an accident. do not drive the vehicle over or stop the vehicle near flammable materials. the exhaust system and exhaust gases can be extremely hot. these hot parts may cause a fire if there is any flammable material nearby. during normal driving, do not turn off the engine. turning the engine off while driving will not cause loss of steering or brak- ing control, but the power assist to these systems will be lost. this will make it more difficult to steer and brake, so you should pull over and stop the vehicle as soon as it is safe to do so. however, in the event of an emergency, such as if it becomes impossible to stop the vehicle in the normal way: p.502 use engine braking (shift posi- tion b1 or downshift2, 3) to maintain a safe speed when driving down a steep hill. using the brakes continuously may cause the brakes to over- heat and lose effectiveness. (p.169, 172, 176) 1:vehicles with a continuously variable transmission (without paddle shift switches) 2:vehicles with a continuously variable transmission (with paddle shift switches) 3:vehicles with a manual trans- mission do not adjust the positions of the steering wheel, the seat, or the inside or outside rear view mirrors while driving. doing so may result in a loss of vehicle control. always check that all passen- gers arms, heads or other parts of their body are not outside the vehicle. 154 4-1. before driving warning do not drive in excess of the speed limit. even if the legal speed limit permits it, do not drive over 85 mph (140 kmh) unless your vehicle has high-speed capability tires. driv- ing over 85 mph (140 kmh) may result in tire failure, loss of control and possible injury. be sure to consult a tire dealer to determine whether the tires on your vehicle are high-speed capability tires or not before driving at such speeds. when driving on slippery road surfaces sudden braking, acceleration and steering may cause tire slippage and reduce your ability to control the vehicle. sudden acceleration, engine braking due to shifting, or changes in engine speed could cause the vehicle to skid. after driving through a puddle, lightly depress the brake pedal to make sure that the brakes are functioning properly. wet brake pads may prevent the brakes from functioning prop- erly. if the brakes on only one side are wet and not functioning properly, steering control may be affected. when shifting the shift lever vehicles with a continuously variable transmission: do not let the vehicle roll backward while a forward driving position is selected, or roll forward while the shift lever is in r. doing so may cause the engine to stall or lead to poor brake and steering performance, resulting in an accident or damage to the vehicle. vehicles with a continuously variable transmission: do not shift the shift lever to p while the vehicle is moving. doing so can damage the trans- mission and may result in a loss of vehicle control. do not shift the shift lever to r while the vehicle is moving for- ward. doing so can damage the trans- mission and may result in a loss of vehicle control. do not shift the shift lever to a driving position while the vehicle is moving backward. doing so can damage the trans- mission and may result in a loss of vehicle control. moving the shift lever to n while the vehicle is moving will disen- gage the engine from the trans- mission. engine braking is not available when n is selected. vehicles with a continuously variable transmission: be care- ful not to shift the shift lever with the accelerator pedal depressed. shifting the shift lever to any positions other than p or n may lead to unexpected rapid acceleration of the vehicle that may cause an accident and result in death or serious injury. if you hear a squealing or scraping noise (brake pad wear indicators) have the brake pads checked and replaced by your toyota dealer as soon as possible. rotor damage may result if the pads are not replaced when needed. it is dangerous to drive the vehicle when the wear limits of the brake pads andor those of the brake discs are exceeded. 155 4-1. before driving 4 driving warning when the vehicle is stopped do not race the engine. if the vehicle is in any gear other than p (continuously variable transmission) or n, the vehicle may accelerate suddenly and unexpectedly, causing an acci- dent. vehicles with a continuously variable transmission: in order to prevent accidents due to the vehicle rolling away, always keep depressing the brake pedal while the engine is run- ning, and apply the parking brake as necessary. if the vehicle is stopped on an incline, in order to prevent acci- dents caused by the vehicle roll- ing forward or backward, always depress the brake pedal and securely apply the parking brake as needed. avoid revving or racing the engine. running the engine at high speed while the vehicle is stopped may cause the exhaust system to overheat, which could result in a fire if combustible material is nearby. when the vehicle is parked do not leave glasses, cigarette lighters, spray cans, or soft drink cans in the vehicle when it is in the sun. doing so may result in the fol- lowing:  gas may leak from a cigarette lighter or spray can, and may lead to a fire.  the temperature inside the vehicle may cause the plastic lenses and plastic material of glasses to deform or crack.  soft drink cans may fracture, causing the contents to spray over the interior of the vehicle, and may also cause a short cir- cuit in the vehicles electrical components. do not leave cigarette lighters in the vehicle. if a cigarette lighter is in a place such as the glove box or on the floor, it may be lit accidentally when luggage is loaded or the seat is adjusted, causing a fire. do not attach adhesive discs to the windshield or windows. do not place containers such as air fresheners on the instrument panel or dashboard. adhesive discs or containers may act as lenses, causing a fire in the vehicle. do not leave a door or window open if the curved glass is coated with a metallized film such as a silver-colored one. reflected sunlight may cause the glass to act as a lens, caus- ing a fire. vehicles with a continuously variable transmission: always apply the parking brake, shift the shift lever to p, stop the engine and lock the vehicle. do not leave the vehicle unat- tended while the engine is run- ning. if the vehicle is parked with the shift lever in p but the parking brake is not set, the vehicle may start to move, possibly leading to an accident. vehicles with a manual trans- mission: always apply the park- ing brake, stop the engine and lock the vehicle. do not leave the vehicle unat- tended while the engine is run- ning. 156 4-1. before driving warning do not touch the exhaust pipes while the engine is running or immediately after turning the engine off. doing so may cause burns. when taking a nap in the vehi- cle always turn the engine off. other- wise, if you accidentally move the shift lever or depress the acceler- ator pedal, this could cause an accident or fire due to engine overheating. additionally, if the vehicle is parked in a poorly venti- lated area, exhaust gases may collect and enter the vehicle, lead- ing to death or a serious health hazard. when braking when the brakes are wet, drive more cautiously. braking distance increases when the brakes are wet, and this may cause one side of the vehicle to brake differently than the other side. also, the parking brake may not securely hold the vehicle. if the brake booster device does not operate, do not follow other vehicles closely and avoid hills or sharp turns that require brak- ing. in this case, braking is still pos- sible, but the brake pedal should be depressed more firmly than usual. also, the brak- ing distance will increase. have your brakes fixed immediately. do not pump the brake pedal if the engine stalls. each push on the brake pedal uses up the reserve for the power-assisted brakes. the brake system consists of 2 individual hydraulic systems; if one of the systems fails, the other will still operate. in this case, the brake pedal should be depressed more firmly than usual and the braking distance will increase. have your brakes fixed immediately. if the vehicle becomes stuck do not spin the wheels exces- sively when a driven wheel is up in the air, or the vehicle is stuck in sand, mud, etc. this may damage the driveline components or pro- pel the vehicle forward or back- ward, causing an accident. notice when driving the vehicle (vehicles with a continuously variable transmission) do not depress the accelerator and brake pedals at the same time during driving, as this may restrain the engine output. do not use the accelerator pedal or depress the accelera- tor and brake pedals at the same time to hold the vehicle on a hill. when driving the vehicle (vehicles with a manual trans- mission) do not depress the accelerator and brake pedals at the same time during driving, as this may restrain the engine output. do not shift gears unless the clutch pedal is fully depressed. after shifting, do not release the clutch pedal abruptly. doing so may damage the clutch, trans- mission and gears. 157 4-1. before driving 4 driving notice observe the following precau- tions. failure to do so may cause excessive premature wear or damage to the clutch, eventu- ally making it difficult to acceler- ate and start off from a stop. have the vehicle inspected by your toyota dealer.  do not rest your foot on the clutch pedal or depress it any time other than when shifting. doing so may cause clutch trou- ble.  do not use any gear other than the 1st gear when starting off and moving forward. doing so may damage the clutch.  do not use the clutch pedal to adjust vehicle speed. doing so may damage the clutch.  when stopping the vehicle with the shift lever in a position other than n, make sure to fully depress the clutch pedal and stop the vehicle using the brakes. do not shift the shift lever to r without the vehicle completely stopped. doing so may damage the clutch, transmission and gears. when parking the vehicle (vehicles with a continuously variable transmission) always set the parking brake and shift the shift lever to p. failure to do so may cause the vehicle to move or the vehicle may acceler- ate suddenly if the accelerator pedal is accidentally depressed. avoiding damage to vehicle parts do not turn the steering wheel fully in either direction and hold it there for an extended period of time. doing so may damage the power steering motor. when driving over bumps in the road, drive as slowly as possible to avoid damaging the wheels, underside of the vehicle, etc. if you get a flat tire while driv- ing a flat or damaged tire may cause the following situations. hold the steering wheel firmly and gradu- ally depress the brake pedal to slow down the vehicle. it may be difficult to control your vehicle. the vehicle will make abnormal sounds or vibrations. the vehicle will lean abnor- mally. information on what to do in case of a flat tire (p.534) when encountering flooded roads do not drive on a road that has flooded after heavy rain etc. doing so may cause the following serious damage to the vehicle: engine stalling short in electrical components engine damage caused by water immersion in the event that you drive on a flooded road and the vehicle becomes flooded or stuck in mud or sand, be sure to have your toyota dealer check the following: 158 4-1. before driving cargo capacity depends on the total weight of the occupants. (cargo capacity)  (total load capacity)  (total weight of occupants) steps for determining correct load limit  (1) locate the statement the combined weight of occupants and cargo should never exceed xxx kg or xxx lbs. on your vehicles placard. (2) determine the combined weight of the driver and passen- gers that will be riding in your vehicle. (3) subtract the combined weight of the driver and passen- gers from xxx kg or xxx lbs. (4) the resulting figure equals the available amount of cargo and luggage load capacity. for example, if the xxx amount equals 1400 lbs. and there will be five 150 lb passen- gers in your vehicle, the amount of available cargo and luggage load capacity is 650 lbs. (1400  notice brake function changes in the quantity and quality of the engine oil, transaxle fluid, clutch fluid, etc. lubricant condition for the bear- ings and suspension joints (where possible), and the func- tion of all joints, bearings, etc. cargo and luggage take notice of the following information about storage precautions, cargo capacity and load: capacity and distribution 159 4-1. before driving 4 driving 750 (5  150)  650 lbs.) (5) determine the combined weight of luggage and cargo being loaded on the vehicle. that weight may not safely exceed the available cargo and luggage load capacity calcu- lated in step 4. (6) if your vehicle will be towing a trailer, load from your trailer will be transferred to your vehi- cle. consult this manual to determine how this reduces the available cargo and luggage load capacity of your vehicle. (p.161) toyota does not recommend towing a trailer with your vehicle. your vehicle is not designed for trailer towing. cargo capacity total load capacity (vehicle capacity weight) (p.556) when 2 people with the com- bined weight of a lb. (kg) are rid- ing in your vehicle, which has a total load capacity (vehicle capacity weight) of b lb. (kg), the available amount of cargo and luggage load capacity will be c lb. (kg) as follows: b2 lb. (kg) - a1 lb. (kg)  c3 lb. (kg) 1:a weight of people 2:b total load capacity 3:c available cargo and luggage load in this condition, if 3 more passen- gers with the combined weight of d lb. (kg) get on, the available cargo and luggage load will be reduced e lb. (kg) as follows: c lb. (kg) - d4 lb. (kg)  e5 lb. (kg) 4:d additional weight of people 5:e available cargo and luggage load as shown in the example above, if the number of occupants increases, the cargo and lug- gage load will be reduced by an amount that equals the increased weight due to the additional occupants. in other words, if an increase in the num- ber of occupants causes an excess of the total load capacity (combined weight of occupants plus cargo and luggage load), you must reduce the cargo and luggage on your vehicle. calculation formula for your vehicle 160 4-1. before driving warning things that must not be car- ried in the trunk the following things may cause a fire if loaded in the trunk: receptacles containing gaso- line aerosol cans storage precautions observe the following precau- tions. failure to do so may prevent the pedals from being depressed properly, may block the drivers vision, or may result in items hit- ting the driver or passengers, pos- sibly causing an accident. stow cargo and luggage in the trunk whenever possible. to prevent cargo and luggage from sliding forward during braking, do not stack anything in the enlarged trunk. keep cargo and luggage low, as close to the floor as possible. when you fold down the rear seats, long items should not be placed directly behind the front seats. do not place cargo or luggage in or on the following locations.  at the feet of the driver  on the front passenger or rear seats (when stacking items)  on the package tray  on the instrument panel  on the dashboard secure all items in the occupant compartment. never allow anyone to ride in the enlarged trunk. it is not designed for passengers. they should ride in their seats with their seat belts properly fas- tened. capacity and distribution do not exceed the maximum axle weight rating or the total vehicle weight rating. even if the total load of occu- pants weight and the cargo load is less than the total load capacity, do not apply the load unevenly. improper loading may cause deterioration of steering or braking control which may cause death or serious injury. 161 4-1. before driving 4 driving total load capacity and seating capacity these details are also described on the tire and loading information label. (p.484) vehicle load limits vehicle load limits include total load capacity, seating capacity, towing capacity and cargo capacity. total load capacity (vehicle capacity weight): p.556 total load capacity means the combined weight of occupants, cargo and luggage. seating capacity: p.556 seating capacity means the max- imum number of occupants whose estimated average weight is 150 lb. (68 kg) per person. towing capacity toyota does not recommend tow- ing a trailer with your vehicle. cargo capacity cargo capacity may increase or decrease depending on the weight and the number of occu- pants. warning overloading the vehicle do not overload the vehicle. it may not only cause damage to the tires, but also degrade steer- ing and braking ability, resulting in an accident. trailer towing toyota does not recom- mend towing a trailer with your vehicle. toyota also does not recommend the installation of a tow hitch or the use of a tow hitch carrier for a wheelchair, scooter, bicycle, etc. your vehicle is not designed for trailer tow- ing or for the use of tow hitch mounted carriers. 162 4-1. before driving dinghy towing your vehicle is not designed to be dinghy towed (with 4 wheels on the ground) behind a motor home. notice to avoid serious damage to your vehicle do not tow your vehicle with the four wheels on the ground. 163 4-2. driving procedures 4 driving 4-2.driving procedures 1 check that the parking brake is set.

range is only intended to help the driver in determining the following distance between the drivers own vehicle and a designated vehicle traveling ahead. it is not a mechanism that allows careless or inattentive driv- ing, and it is not a system that can assist the driver in low-visibility conditions. it is still necessary for driver to pay close attention to the vehi- cles surroundings. assisting the driver to judge proper following distance the dynamic radar cruise control with full-speed range determines whether the following distance between the drivers own vehicle and a designated vehicle traveling ahead is within a set range. it is not capable of making any other type of judgement. therefore, it is absolutely necessary for the driver to remain vigilant and to determine whether or not there is a possibility of danger in any given situation. assisting the driver to operate the vehicle the dynamic radar cruise control with full-speed range does not include functions which will pre- vent or avoid collisions with vehi- cles ahead of your vehicle. therefore, if there is ever any possibility of danger, the driver must take immediate and direct control of the vehicle and act appropriately in order to ensure the safety of all involved. situations unsuitable for dynamic radar cruise control with full-speed range do not use dynamic radar cruise control with full-speed range in any of the following situations. doing so may result in inappropri- ate speed control and could cause an accident resulting in death or serious injury. roads where there are pedes- trians,

the presence of vehicles up to approximately 328 ft. (100 m) ahead, determines the current vehi- cle-to-vehicle following distance, and operates to maintain a suitable following distance from the vehicle ahead. the desired vehi- cle-to-vehicle distance can also be set by operating the vehi- cle-to-vehicle distance switch. when driving on downhill slopes, the vehicle-to-vehicle distance may become shorter. example of constant speed cruising when there are no vehicles ahead the vehicle travels at the speed set by the driver. example of deceleration cruising and follow-up cruising when a preceding vehicle driving slower than the set speed appears when a vehicle is detected running ahead of you, the system automatically decelerates your vehicle. when a greater reduction in vehicle speed is nec- essary, the system applies the brakes (the stop lights will come on at this time). the system will respond to changes in the speed of the vehicle ahead in order to maintain the vehicle-to-vehicle distance set by the driver. approach warning warns you when the system cannot decelerate suffi- ciently to prevent your vehicle from closing in on the vehicle ahead. when the vehicle ahead of you stops, your vehicle will also stop (vehicle is stopped by system control). after the vehicle ahead starts off, pressing the res switch or depressing the accelerator pedal (start-off operation) will resume follow-up cruising. if the start-off operation is not performed, system control continues to keep your vehicle stopped. driving in vehicle-to-vehicle distance control mode 233 4-5. using the driving support systems 4 driving when the turn signal lever is operated and your vehicle moves to an over- taking lane while driving at 50 mph (80 kmh) or more, the vehicle will accel- erate to help to overtake a passing vehicle. the systems identification of what is an overtaking lane may be determined solely based on the location of the steering wheel in the vehicle (left side driver position versus right side driver position.) if the vehicle is driven to a region where the overtaking lane is on a different side from where the vehi- cle is normally driven, the vehicle may accelerate when the turn signal lever is operated in the opposite direction to the overtaking lane (e.g., if the driver normally operates the vehicle in a region where the overtaking lane is to the right but then drives to a region where the overtaking lane is to the left, the vehicle may accelerate when the right turn signal is activated). example of acceleration when there are no longer any preceding vehicles driving slower than the set speed the system accelerates until the set speed is reached. the system then returns to constant speed cruising. 1 press the cruise control main switch to activate the cruise control. dynamic radar cruise control indi- cator will come on and a message will be displayed on the multi-infor- mation display. press the switch again to deactivate the cruise con- trol. if the cruise control main switch is pressed and held for 1.5 seconds or more, the system turns on in constant speed control mode.

stop operating to ensure proper operation of the brakes, trac and vsc. hill-start assist control does not operate effectively when do not overly rely on hill-start assist control. hill-start assist control may not operate effec- tively on steep inclines and roads covered with ice. unlike the parking brake, hill-start assist control is not intended to hold the vehicle sta- tionary for an extended period of time. do not attempt to use hill-start assist control to hold the vehicle on an incline, as doing so may lead to an acci- dent. 276 4-5. using the driving support systems warning when the tracvsc is acti- vated the slip indicator light flashes. always drive carefully. reckless driving may cause an accident. exercise particular care when the indicator light flashes. when the tracvsc systems are turned off be especially careful and drive at a speed appropriate to the road conditions. as these are the sys- tems to help ensure vehicle stabil- ity and driving force, do not turn the tracvsc systems off unless necessary. replacing tires make sure that all tires are of the specified size, brand, tread pat- tern and total load capacity. in addition, make sure that the tires are inflated to the recommended tire inflation pressure level. the abs, trac and vsc sys- tems will not function correctly if different tires are installed on the vehicle. contact your toyota dealer for fur- ther information when replacing tires or wheels. handling of tires and the sus- pension using tires with any kind of prob- lem or modifying the suspension will affect the driving assist sys- tems, and may cause a system to malfunction. secondary collision brake do not rely solely upon the sec- ondary collision brake. this sys- tem is designed to help reduce the possibility of further damage due to a secondary collision, how- ever, that effect changes accord- ing to various conditions. overly relying on the system may result in death or serious injury. 277 4-6. driving tips 4 driving 4-6.driving tips use fluids that are appropriate to the prevailing outside tem- peratures.  engine oil  engine coolant  washer fluid have a service technician inspect the condition of the battery. have the vehicle fitted with four snow tires or purchase a set of tire chains for the front tires. ensure that all tires are the same size and brand, and that chains match the size of the tires. winter driving tips carry out the necessary preparations and inspec- tions before driving the vehicle in winter. always drive the vehicle in a man- ner appropriate to the pre- vailing weather conditions. pre-winter preparations warning driving with snow tires observe the following precautions to reduce the risk of accidents. failure to do so may result in a loss of vehicle control and cause death or serious injury. use tires of the size specified. maintain the recommended level of air pressure. do not drive in excess of 75 mph (120 kmh), regardless of the type of snow tires being used. use snow tires on all, not just some wheels. driving with tire chains observe the following precautions to reduce the risk of accidents. failure to do so may result in the vehicle being unable to be driven safely, and may cause death or serious injury. do not drive in excess of the speed limit specified for the tire chains being used, or 30 mph (50 kmh), whichever is lower. avoid driving on bumpy road surfaces or over potholes. avoid sudden acceleration, abrupt steering, sudden brak- ing and shifting operations that cause sudden engine braking. slow down sufficiently before entering a curve to ensure that vehicle control is maintained. do not use lta (lane tracing assist) system. (if equipped) do not use lda (lane depar- ture alert with steering control) system. (if equipped) notice repairing or replacing snow tires (vehicles with a tire pres- sure warning system) request repairs or replacement of snow tires from toyota dealers or legitimate tire retailers. this is because the removal and attachment of snow tires affects the operation of the tire pressure warning valves and transmitters. 278 4-6. driving tips perform the following according to the driving conditions: do not try to forcibly open a window or move a wiper that is frozen. pour warm water over the frozen area to melt the ice. wipe away the water immediately to prevent it from freezing. to ensure proper operation of the climate control system fan, remove any snow that has accumulated on the air inlet vents in front of the wind- shield. check for and remove any excess ice or snow that may have accumulated on the exterior lights, vehicles roof, chassis, around the tires or on the brakes. remove any snow or mud from the bottom of your shoes before getting in the vehicle. accelerate the vehicle slowly, keep a safe distance between you and the vehicle ahead, and drive at a reduced speed suit- able to road conditions. park the vehicle and shift the shift lever to p (continuously variable transmission), or 1 or r (manual transmission) without setting the parking brake. the parking brake may freeze up, preventing it from being released. if the vehicle is parked without setting the parking brake, make sure to block the wheels. failure to do so may be dan- gerous because it may cause the vehicle to move unexpect- edly, possibly leading to an accident. vehicles with a continuously variable transmission: if the vehicle is parked without set- ting the parking brake, con- firm that the shift lever cannot be moved out of p. : the shift lever will be locked if it is attempted to be shifted from p to any other position without depressing the brake pedal. if the shift lever can be shifted from p, there may be a problem with the shift lock system. have the vehi- cle inspected by your toyota dealer immediately. use the correct tire chain size when mounting the tire chains. chain size is regulated for each tire size. before driving the vehicle when driving the

may cause a noise from the speakers of the audiovisual system which you are listening to. however, this does not indicate a malfunction. usually, a problem with radio reception does not mean there is a problem with the radio  it is just the normal result of condi- tions outside the vehicle. for example, nearby buildings and terrain can interfere with fm reception. power lines or phone wires can interfere with am sig- nals. and of course, radio sig- nals have a limited range. the farther the vehicle is from a sta- tion, the weaker its signal will be. in addition, reception condi- tions change constantly as the vehicle moves. here are some common recep- tion problems that may not indi- cate a problem with the radio as described. fm fading and drifting stations: generally, the effective range of fm is about 25 miles (40 km). once outside this range, you may notice fading and drifting, which increase with the distance from the radio transmitter. they are often accompanied by dis- tortion. multi-path: fm signals are reflective, making it possible for 2 signals to reach the vehicles antenna at the same time. if this happens, the signals will cancel each other out, causing a momentary flutter or loss of reception. static and fluttering: these occur when signals are blocked by buildings, trees or other large objects. increasing the bass level may reduce static and flut- tering. station swapping: if the fm sig- nal being listened to is inter- rupted or weakened, and there is another strong station nearby on the fm band, the radio may tune in the second station until the original signal can be picked up again. am fading: am broadcasts are reflected by the upper atmo- sphere  especially at night. these reflected signals can interfere with those received directly from the radio station, causing the radio station to sound alternately strong and weak. operating information notice to avoid damage to the audiovisual system: be careful not to spill beverages over the audiovisual system. radio 353 5-10. tips for operating the audiovisual system 5 audio station interference: when a reflected signal and a signal received directly from a radio station are very nearly the same frequency, they can interfere with each other, making it diffi- cult to hear the broadcast. static: am is easily affected by external sources of electrical noise, such as high tension power lines, lightening or electri- cal motors. this results in static. siriusxm cargo loaded on the roof lug- gage carrier, especially metal objects, may adversely affect the reception of siriusxm sat- ellite radio. alternation or modifications carried out without appropri- ate authorization may invali- date the users right to operate the equipment. certification use of the made for apple badge

plays back files with .mp3.wma.m4a file extensions as mp3wmaaac files respec- tively. to prevent noise and playback errors, use the appropriate file extension. mp3 files are compatible with the id3 tag ver. 1.0, ver. 1.1, ver. 2.2 and ver. 2.3 formats. this system cannot display disc title, track title and artist name in other formats. wmaaac files can contain a wmaaac tag that is used in the same way as an id3 tag. wmaaac tags carry infor- mation such as track title and artist name. the emphasis function is available only when playing mp3 files. this system can play back aac files encoded by itunes. the sound quality of mp3wma files generally improves with higher bit rates. m3u playlists are not compati- ble with the audio player. mp3i (mp3 interactive) and mp3pro formats are not compatible with the audio player. the player is compatible with vbr (variable bit rate). when playing back files recorded as vbr (variable bit rate) files, the play time will not be correctly displayed if the fast forward or reverse operations are used. it is not possible to check fold- ers that do not include mp3wmaaac files. mp3wmaaac files in fold- ers up to 8 levels deep can be played. however, the start of playback may be delayed when using usb memory containing numerous levels of folders. for this reason, we recommend creating usb memory with no more than 2 levels of folders. 357

indicating internal damage a tire goes flat repeatedly or can- not be properly repaired due to the size or location of a cut or other damage if you are not sure, consult with your toyota dealer. tire life any tire over 6 years old must be checked by a qualified technician even if it has seldom or never been used or damage is not obvious. low profile tires (18-inch tires) generally, low profile tires will wear more rapidly and tire grip perfor- mance will be reduced on snowy andor icy roads when compared to standard tires. be sure to use snow tires or tire chains on snowy andor icy roads and drive carefully at a speed appropriate for road and weather conditions. maximum load of tire check that the maximum load of the replacement tire is greater than 12 of the gross axle weight ratings (gawr) of either the front axle or the rear axle, whichever is greater. for the gawr, see the certification label. for the maximum load of the tire, see the load limit at maximum cold tire inflation pressure mentioned on the sidewall of the tire.

(p.277) if the tread on snow tires wears down below 0.16 in. (4 mm) the effectiveness of the tires as snow tires is lost. checking the tire valves when replacing the tires, check the tire valves for deformation, cracks, and other damage. warning when inspecting or replacing tires observe the following precautions to prevent accidents. failure to do so may cause dam- age to parts of the drive train as well as dangerous handling char- acteristics, which may lead to an accident resulting in death or seri- ous injury. do not mix tires of different makes, models or tread pat- terns. also, do not mix tires of remark- ably different treadwear. do not use tire sizes other than those recommended by toyota. do not mix differently con- structed tires (radial, bias-belted or bias-ply tires). do not mix summer, all season and snow tires. do not use tires that have been used on another vehicle. do not use tires if you do not know how they were used previ- ously. 477 7-3. do-it-yourself maintenance 7 maintenance and care rotate the tires in the order shown. front to equalize tire wear and extend tire life, toyota recommends that tire rotation is carried out at the same interval as tire inspection. vehicles with a tire pressure warn- ing system: do not fail to initialize the tire pressure warning system after tire rotation. your vehicle is equipped with a tire pressure warning system that uses tire pressure warning valves and transmitters to detect low tire inflation pressure before serious problems arise. if the tire pressure drops below a predetermined level, the driver is warned by a warning light. (p.515) routine tire inflation pressure checks the tire pressure warning system does not replace routine tire inflation pressure checks. make sure to check tire inflation pressure as part of your routine of daily vehicle checks. notice low profile tires (18-inch tires) low profile tires may cause greater damage than usual to the tire wheel when sustaining impact from the road surface. therefore, pay attention to the following: be sure to use proper tire infla- tion pressure. if tires are under-inflated, they may be damaged more severely. avoid potholes, uneven pave- ment, curbs and other road haz- ards. failure to do so may lead to severe tire and wheel dam- age. if tire inflation pressure of each tire becomes low while driving do not continue driving, or your tires andor wheels may be ruined. driving on rough roads take particular care when driving on roads with loose surfaces or potholes. these conditions may cause losses in tire inflation pressure, reducing the cushioning ability of the tires. in addition, driving on rough roads may cause damage to the tires themselves, as well as the vehicles wheels and body. tire rotation tire pressure warning system (if equipped) 478 7-3. do-it-yourself maintenance situations in which the tire pressure warning system may not operate properly in the following cases, the tire pressure warning system may not operate properly.  if non-genuine toyota wheels are used.  a tire has been replaced with a tire that is not an oe (original equipment) tire.  a tire has been replaced with a tire that is not of the specified size.  tire chains, etc. are equipped.  an auxiliary-supported run-flat tire is equipped.  if a window tint that affects the radio wave signals is installed.  if there is a lot of snow or ice on the vehicle, particularly around the wheels or wheel housings.  if the tire inflation pressure is extremely higher than the speci- fied level.  if tires not equipped with tire pres- sure warning valves and transmit- ters are used.  if the id code on the tire pressure warning valves and transmitters is not registered in the tire pressure warning computer. performance may be affected in the following situations.  near a tv tower, electric power plant, gas station, radio station, large display, airport or other facil- ity that generates strong radio waves or electrical noise.  when carrying a portable radio, cellular phone, cordless phone or other wireless communication device. when the vehicle is parked, the time taken for the warning to start or go off could be extended. when tire inflation pressure declines rapidly for example when a tire has burst, the warning may not function. warning performance of the tire pressure warning system the warning of the tire pressure warning system will change in accordance with driving conditions. for this reason, the system may give a warning even if the tire pres- sure does not reach a low enough level, or if the pressure is higher than the pressure that was adjusted to when the system was initialized. tire pressure warning system certification 479 7-3. do-it-yourself maintenance 7 maintenance and care 480 7-3. do-it-yourself maintenance when replacing tires or wheels, tire pressure warning valves and transmitters must also be installed. when new tire pressure warning valves and transmitters are installed, new id codes must be registered in the tire pressure warning computer and the tire pressure warning system must be initialized. have tire pressure warning valves and transmitter id codes registered by your toyota dealer. (p.482) replacing tires and wheels if the id code of the tire pressure warning valve and transmitter is not registered, the tire pressure warning system will not work properly. after driving for about 20 minutes, the tire pressure warning light blinks for 1 minute and stays on to indicate a system malfunction. installing tire pressure warning valves and trans- mitters (vehicles with a tire pressure warning sys- tem) notice repairing or replacing tires, wheels, tire pressure warn- ing valves, transmitters and tire valve caps when removing or fitting the wheels, tires or the tire pressure warning valves and transmit- ters, contact your toyota dealer as the tire pressure warning valves and transmitters may be damaged if not handled cor- rectly. 481 7-3. do-it-yourself maintenance 7 maintenance and care the tire pressure warning system must be initialized in the following circum- stances: when rotating front and rear tires which have different tire inflation pressures. when changing the tire size. when the tire inflation pres- sure is changed such as when changing traveling speed or load weight. when changing between two registered wheel sets. when the tire pressure warning system is initialized, the current tire inflation pressure is set as the benchmark pressure. how to initialize the tire pressure warning system 1 park the vehicle in a safe place and turn the engine switch off. initialization cannot be performed while the vehicle is moving. 2 adjust the tire inflation pres- sure to the specified cold tire inflation pressure level. (p.564) make sure to adjust the tire pres- sure to the specified cold tire infla- tion pressure level. the tire pressure warning system will oper- ate based on this pressure level. 3 turn the engine switch to on. 4 press or of the meter control switch to select . 5 press or to select vehicle settings and then press and hold . 6 press or to select tpws and then press . 7 press or to select set pressure. then press and hold until the tire pres- notice make sure to install the tire valve caps. if the tire valve caps are not installed, water could enter the tire pressure warning valves and the tire pressure warning valves could be bound. when replacing tire valve caps, do not use tire valve caps other than those specified. the cap may become stuck. to avoid damage to the tire pressure warning valves and transmitters when a tire is repaired with liquid sealants, the tire pressure warn- ing valve and transmitter may not operate properly. if a liquid seal- ant is used, contact your toyota dealer or other qualified service shop as soon as possible. make sure to replace the tire pressure warning valve and transmitter when replacing the tire.

pressure is at the recommended level, the tire pressure warning light may come 532 8-2. steps to take in an emergency onflash. warning do not drive the vehicle with a flat tire do not continue driving with a flat tire. driving even a short distance with a flat tire can damage the tire and the wheel beyond repair. driving with a flat tire may cause a circumferential groove on the side wall. in such a case, the tire may explode when using a repair kit. when fixing the flat tire stop your vehicle in a safe and flat area. do not touch the wheels or the area around the brakes immedi- ately after the vehicle has been driven. after the vehicle has been driven, the wheels and the area around the brakes may be extremely hot. touching these areas with hands, feet or other body parts may result in burns. connect the valve and hose securely with the tire installed on the vehicle. if the hose is not properly connected to the valve, air leakage may occur as seal- ant may be sprayed out. if the hose comes off the valve while inflating the tire, there is a risk that the hose will move abruptly due to air pressure. after inflation of the tire has completed, the sealant may splatter when the hose is dis- connected or some air is let out of the tire. follow the operation procedure to repair the tire. if the proce- dures not followed, the sealant may spray out. keep back from the tire while it is being repaired, as there is a chance of it bursting while the repair operation is being per- formed. if you notice any cracks or deformation of the tire, turn off the compressor switch and stop the repair operation imme- diately. the repair kit may overheat if operated for a long period of time. do not operate the repair kit continuously for more than 40 minutes. parts of the repair kit become hot during operation. be careful handling the repair kit during and after operation. do not touch the metal part connecting the bottle and the compressor. it will be extremely hot. do not attach the vehicle speed warning sticker to an area other than the one indicated. if the sticker is attached to an area where an srs airbag is located, such as the pad of the steering wheel, it may prevent the srs airbag from operating properly. driving to spread the liquid sealant evenly observe the following precautions to reduce the risk of accidents. failing to do so may result in a loss of vehicle control and cause death or serious injury. drive the vehicle carefully at a low speed. be especially careful when turning and cornering. if the vehicle does not drive straight or you feel a

gasoline you are using. if driveability problems persist, try changing the brand of gasoline. if this does not correct the problem, consult your toyota dealer. recommendation of the use of gasoline containing detergent additives toyota recommends the use of gasoline that contains detergent additives to avoid the build-up of engine deposits. all gasoline sold in the u.s.a. con- tains minimum detergent additives to clean andor keep clean intake systems, per epas lowest addi- tives concentration program. toyota strongly recommends the use of top tier detergent gaso- line. for more information on top tier detergent gasoline and a list of marketers, please go to the offi- cial website www.toptiergas.com. recommendation of the use of low emissions gasoline gasolines containing oxygenates such as ethers and ethanol, as well as reformulated gasolines, are avail- able in some cities. these fuels are typically acceptable for use, provid- ing they meet other fuel require- ments. toyota recommends these fuels, since the formulations allow for reduced vehicle emissions. non-recommendation of the use of blended gasoline use only gasoline containing up to 15 ethanol. do not use any flex-fuel or gas- oline that could contain more than 15 ethanol, including from any pump labeled e30 (30 ethanol  ), e50 (50 ethanol  ), e85 (85 ethanol  ) (which are only some examples of fuel containing more than 15 ethanol). if you use gasohol in your vehicle, be sure that it has an octane rat- ing no lower than 87. toyota does not recommend the use of gasoline containing metha- nol. non-recommendation of the use of gasoline containing mmt some gasoline contains an octane enhancing additive called mmt (methylcyclopentadienyl manga- nese tricarbonyl). toyota does not recommend the use of gasoline that contains mmt. if fuel containing mmt is used, your emission control system may be fuel information you must only use unleaded gasoline. select octane rating of 87 (research octane number 91) or higher. use of unleaded gasoline with an octane rating lower than 87 may result in engine knock- ing. persistent knocking can lead to engine damage. at minimum, the gasoline you use should meet the specifica- tions of astm d4814 in the u.s.a. 568 9-1. specifications adversely affected. the malfunction indicator lamp on the instrument cluster may come on. if this happens, contact your toyota dealer for service. if your engine knocks consult your toyota dealer. you may occasionally notice light knocking for a short time while accelerating or driving uphill. this is normal and there is no need for concern. notice notice on fuel quality do not use improper fuels. if improper fuels are used, the engine will be damaged. do not use leaded gasoline. leaded gasoline can cause damage to your vehicles three-way catalytic converters causing the emission control system to malfunction. do not use gasohol other than the type previously stated. other gasohol may cause fuel system damage or vehicle per- formance problems. using unleaded gasoline with an octane number or rating lower than the level previously stated will cause persistent heavy knocking. at worst, this will lead to engine damage. fuel-related poor driveability if poor driveability (poor hot start- ing, vaporization, engine knock- ing, etc.) is encountered after using a different type of fuel, dis- continue the use of that type of fuel. when refueling with gasohol take care not to spill gasohol. it can damage your vehicles paint. 569 9-1. specifications 9 vehicle specifications full-size tire tire size

the treadwear grade is a com- parative rating based on the wear rate of the tire when tested under controlled conditions on a specified government test course. for example, a tire graded 150 tire section names uniform tire quality grading 573 9-1. specifications 9 vehicle specifications would wear one and a half (1 - 12) times as well on the government course as a tire graded 100. the relative performance of tires depends upon the actual conditions of their use. performance may differ significantly from the norm due to variations in driving habits, service practices and differences in road characteristics and climate. traction aa, a, b, c the traction grades, from high- est to lowest, are aa, a, b and c, and they represent the tires ability to stop on wet pavement as measured under controlled conditions on specified govern- ment test surfaces of asphalt and concrete. a tire marked c may have poor traction performance. warning: the traction grade assigned to this tire is based on braking (straight ahead) traction tests and does not include corner- ing (turning) traction. temperature a, b, c the temperature grades are a (the highest), b, and c, repre- senting the tires resistance to the generation of heat and its ability to dissipate heat when tested under controlled condi- tions on a specified indoor labo- ratory test wheel. sustained high temperature can cause the material of the tire to degenerate and reduce tire life, and excessive temperature can lead to sudden tire failure. grade c corresponds to a level of performance which all passenger car tires must meet under the fed- eral motor vehicle safety standard no. 109. grades b and a represent higher levels of performance on the labo- ratory test wheel than the minimum required by law. warning: the temperature grades of a tire assume that it is properly inflated and not overloaded. excessive speed, underinflation, or excessive loading, either sepa- rately or in combination, can cause heat buildup and possible tire fail- ure. glossary of tire terminology tire related term meaning cold tire inflation pressure tire pressure when the vehicle has been parked for three hours or more, or has
